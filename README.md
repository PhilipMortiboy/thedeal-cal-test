# React Calender Test

## Objective
To re-produce the functionality of the unix `cal` command in React

The `cal` command outputs a simple calendar for the given month, with the current date highlighted

To get you started, this project has been bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

## Requirements
- The first row of the calendar should display the current month and year
- The second row of the calendar should display the days of the week, one per column
- The following rows should display the dates of the month, lined up appropriately with the day headings
- The current date should be highlighted

See cal.png for an example of the output

The calender should be rendered with React components as a web page

The current date should be passed to the calendar as a prop
